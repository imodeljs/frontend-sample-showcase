The Tree Samples showcase different ways to construct and utilize an interactive visual tree through iModel.js.

## Purpose

The purpose of this sample is to show off some of the fundamentals of working with trees, specifically:

* Creating a tree with interactive checkboxes
* Using the checkboxes of a tree to perform some other function in an application

## Description

Creating checkboxes as part of your tree can be a helpful visual tool, but they can also be very functional. In this sample, it is shown how your application can utilize checkboxes to perform other operations. In this case, when a checkbox is deselected, it will deselect all other selected checkboxes in the tree.
