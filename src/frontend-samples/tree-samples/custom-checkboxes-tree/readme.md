# Custom Checkboxes Tree Sample

Copyright Â© Bentley Systems, Incorporated. All rights reserved.

The Tree Samples showcase different ways to construct and utilize an interactive visual tree through imodel.js.

## Purpose

The purpose of this sample is to show off some of the fundamentals of working with trees, specifically:

* Creating a checkbox as part of a tree node
* Modifying a tree node checkbox to have a custom icon

## Description

Since trees are designed to be interacted with, many applications may want to allow for elements, such as checkboxes, to be inserted into the tree for additional user interaction options. Allowing a user to select these custom checkboxes can be used for all sorts of different functions within a broader imodel.js application.
