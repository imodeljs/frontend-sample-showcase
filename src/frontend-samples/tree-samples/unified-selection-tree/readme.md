The Tree Samples showcase different ways to construct and utilize an interactive visual tree through imodel.js.

## Purpose

The purpose of this sample is to show off some of the fundamentals of working with trees, specifically:

* Implementing more complex events with trees, such as interacting with a viewport

## Description

The data being shown in a tree is just a textual representation of the different elements being shown in your imodel. This sample demonstrates this by allowing users to select a textual element from the tree, and then seeing that same element be highlighted in the viewport.
