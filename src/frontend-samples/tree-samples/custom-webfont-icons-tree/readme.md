* Pulling non-textual information, such as icons, from the presentation rules of an imodel

## Description

The presentation rules of an imodel contain more than just the textual data being shown in the tree hierarchy. They can also contain other pieces of information, such as the definitions for icons that can then be used as part of the tree.
