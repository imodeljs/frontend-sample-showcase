# Drag and Drop Tree Sample

## Purpose

Present an interactive tree hierarchy that can be rearranged by drag and dropping nodes.

## Description

The drag and drop functionality is implemented by defining a custom tree node renderer that is both draggable and able to receive drop events. The code for this sample integrates [react-dnd library](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs/overview), which reduces code down to specifying conditions for when drag and dropping is allowed, reacting to hover changes, and updating the tree model when a node is eventually dropped.
