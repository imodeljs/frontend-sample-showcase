The UI Component Samples demonstrate a variety of user interface components that can be used in your iModel.js applications.

## Purpose

The purpose of this sample is to show off the different styles of expandable lists that are available to you when constructing iModel.js applications.

## Description

Many iModel.js applications will want to utilize visual components beyond just the imodel. Whether it be for user interaction or displaying helpful information in a meaningful way, the UI Components will surely be able to enhance your application!

Expandable lists are able to contain a lot of information while also limiting the total amount space being used. They can also contain more than just textual data. For example, the sample gallery on the right side of this showcase was created by using an expandable list, which allows it to store images and buttons too.
