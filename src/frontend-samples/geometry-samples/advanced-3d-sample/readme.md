# Advanced 3d Sample

This sample demonstrates how create non-primitive 3d forms including sweeps and triangulations.

## Purpose

The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate the following:

* Create linear, rotational, and ruled sweeps.
* Create a triangulation bridging the gap between two linestrings.

## Description

This sample demonstrates how to create 3d forms using [PolyfaceBuilder](https://www.imodeljs.org/reference/core-geometry/polyface/polyfacebuilder/).

This geometry sample, like the others, uses a [BlankConnection](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/frontend/blankconnection/) to create a viewport without connecting to an iModel.  It displays geometry in the viewport using [view decorations](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/frontend/viewdecorations/).
