This sample demonstrates how create a line segment from two points.

## Purpose

The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate the following:

* Create a LineSegment from two points.
* Compute a series of points along the line.

## Description

This sample demonstrates how to use [LineSegment3d.create](https://www.itwinjs.org/v2/reference/geometry-core/curve/linesegment3d/createstatic/) and [LineSegment3d](https://www.itwinjs.org/v2/reference/geometry-core/curve/linesegment3d/).fractionToPoint.

This geometry sample, like the others, uses a [BlankConnection](https://www.itwinjs.org/v2/learning/frontend/blankconnection/) to create a viewport without connecting to an iModel.  It displays geometry in the viewport using [view decorations](https://www.itwinjs.org/v2/learning/frontend/viewdecorations/).
