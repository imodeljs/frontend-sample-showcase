# Retrieving Violations

After using the Validation API to retrieve the element IDs of all elements in violation of a validation rule, the sample makes use of several different visualization tools. Each element is assigned a `marker pin` with text describing the rule that the element is in violation of.

In addition, an element is able to be selected in the table, which will cause that element to be `emphasized`, which causes all other elements to become partially transparent. The selected element will have it's color overwritten to be red. If the zoom toggle is not disabled, the selected violating element will be zoomed in on.
